September is coming to an end and I didn't do what I said in my last post (which is to post something when I learn things). I did learn a lot of things from my classes, but I just did not have time to write it down.

Intermediate App Dev is a little challenging this semester. I feel like I am not learning anything, and I always end up getting distracted in class.

My PHP class is really fun though. I really enjoy doing web development classes, **_especially_** when the instructor is great at what he is doing.
