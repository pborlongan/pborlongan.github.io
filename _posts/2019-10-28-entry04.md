Oh man I'm so bad at updating this blog. I've been busy with schoolwork and actual work (making coffee). I haven't gone into editing the layout of this website/blog of mine, which is kind of annoying because I keep procrastinating.

I also haven't had the time to create that "work" project that I mentioned previously, since I've been feeling a little productive and I have a little bit of extra time, I might work on it tonight.
