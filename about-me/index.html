    <p>Before my family moved to Canada in 2016, I was studying Bachelor of Science with the major in Computer Science at <b>Mapua University</b>, but I was not able to finish my program because we had to move right away.</p>
    <p><i>I learned the following while I was studying at Mapua University:</i></p>
    <p>C++, C# OOP Programming, MySQL, Cisco Networking, HTML/CSS, Assembly Language</p>
</div>
<div class="education">
    <p>Since I unfortunately cannot transfer the credits that I got from studying at Mapua University, I decided to apply for <b>NAIT</b>, and I got accepted.</p>
    <p><i>I learned (and still learning about) the following at NAIT:</i></p>
    <p>More C# programming, C# ASP.NET Web Application, HTML5/CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, Bootstrap, PHP/MySQL, Oracle PL/SQL</p>

<p>During my free time I love to watch Twich, YouTube, and Netflix. I also love drawing! I draw mostly digitally using my iPad mini, I'm still learning to do art traditionally!</p>
