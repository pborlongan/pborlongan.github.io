    <p><i>I learned the following while I was studying at Mapua University:</i></p>
    <p><b>C++, C# OOP Programming, MySQL, Cisco Networking, HTML/CSS, Assembly Language</b></p>

    <p>Since I unfortunately cannot transfer the credits that I got from studying at Mapua University, I decided to apply for <b>NAIT</b>, and I got accepted.</p>
