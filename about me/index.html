            <p>I'm <b>Patricia Borlongan</b>, a 22-year-old full-time IT student and part-time barista. I was born and raised in the Philippines for 19 years, and my family decided to move to Canada in 2016 to have a better life.</p>
            <p>My dream is to be an awesome web developer.</p>

            <p>Before we moved to Canada, I was studying <b>Bachelor of Science with the major in Computer Science</b> at <b>Mapua University</b>, but I was not able to finish my program because we had to move right away.</p>
            <p><i>I learned the following while I was studying at Mapua University:</i></p>
            <p><b>C++, C#, MySQL, Cisco Networking, HTML/CSS, Assembly Language</b></p>
        </div>
        <div class="education">
            <p>Since I unfortunately cannot transfer the credits that I got from studying at Mapua University, I decided to apply for <b>NAIT</b>, and I got accepted.</p>
            <p><i>I learned (and still learning about) the following at NAIT:</i></p>
            <p><b>More C#, C# ASP.NET Web Application, HTML5/CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, Bootstrap, PHP/MySQL, Oracle PL/SQL</b></p>
